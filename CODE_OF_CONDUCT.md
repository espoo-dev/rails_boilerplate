# rails_boilerplate Code of Conduct

rails_boilerplate is a community intended for networking and collaboration in the tech community.

We value the participation of each member and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout this repository.

## [Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-event-code-of-conduct#code-of-conduct)

This rails_boilerplate repository is dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience. We do not tolerate harassment of contributor participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another contributor participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for everyone
* Showing empathy towards other contributors

Unacceptable behavior includes:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, or inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention, or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, or sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, or harassing photography or recording
* Harassment of any kind, even in a joking or ironic manner
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at this repository.

Each contributor is entirely responsible for their own actions.

## [Our Responsibilities](https://github.com/espoo-dev/rails_boilerplate/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#our_responsibilities)

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
